            <h1>RISE OF BRICS : CHALLENGING THE WESTERN WORLD ORDER</h1>
            <p>
              The geopolitical and economic landscape of the 21st century is
              being reshaped by the rise of BRICS, an acronym for Brazil,
              Russia, India, China, and South Africa. This coalition of emerging
              economies has garnered significant attention for its potential to
              challenge the traditional dominance of Western powers, primarily
              the United States and Europe. The rise of BRICS represents a shift
              towards a more multipolar world, where influence and power are
              more evenly distributed across different regions.

              <h2>Historical Context and Formation of BRICS</h2>
              <p>
                BRICS began as BRIC in 2001, a term coined by economist Jim
                O'Neill to describe the fast-growing economies of Brazil,
                Russia, India, and China. The group's first formal summit was
                held in 2009 in Yekaterinburg ,Russia and in 2010, South Africa
                was invited to join, leading to the acronym BRICS. The primary
                motivation behind this coalition was to foster economic
                cooperation and development, create a platform for political
                dialogue, and challenge the existing global governance
                structures dominated by the West.

              <h2>Economic Growth and Influence</h2>
              <p>
                The economic rise of BRICS nations has been nothing short of
                remarkable. Collectively, these countries account for over 40%
                of the world’s population and approximately a quarter of global
                GDP. China and India, in particular, have seen rapid economic
                growth. China's transformation into the world's second-largest
                economy and India's significant technological and service sector
                expansion highlight the shifting economic power.
              </p>
              <p>
                Brazil and Russia, rich in natural resources, have leveraged
                their commodities to gain economic influence, while South Africa
                serves as a gateway to the African continent. The economic
                prowess of these nations allows them to influence global
                markets, set commodity prices, and affect economic policies
                worldwide.

            <h2>Political and Strategic Alliances</h2>
            <p>
              BRICS has also sought to establish itself as a significant
              political force. The group's annual summits provide a platform for
              discussing and coordinating policies on global issues such as
              climate change, terrorism, and trade. One of the notable
              achievements is the establishment of the New Development Bank
              (NDB) in 2014, which aims to fund infrastructure and sustainable
              development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies,
              offering an alternative to Western-dominated institutions like the
              World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, BRICS nations have been vocal advocates for reforming
              international institutions to better reflect the current global
              economic realities. They argue that the governance structures of
              the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank are outdated and
              disproportionately favor Western countries. By pushing for greater
              representation and influence within these institutions, BRICS
              seeks to create a more balanced global order.

            <h2>Expansion of BRICS </h2>
            <p>
              On January 1st ,2024 BRICS welcomed its 4 new members Egypt
              ,Ethiopia,Iran and United Arab Emirates and after some delay Saudi
              Arabia joined the group. Expanded BRICS is now home to 3.5 billion
              people approximately 45% of global inhabitants and has a combined
              gdp of 28 trillion dollar almost equal to 28% of global gdp. Many
              more countries from the global South has shown interest in join
              BRICS. Recently Türkiye(turkey) which is a NATO country has also
              shown Interest in joining the group. The expanded BRICS will yield
              enormous influence in the global arena and even be able to
              challenge the influence of the West.

            <h2>Challenges to the West</h2>
            <p>
              The rise of BRICS presents several challenges to the Western
              hegemony. Economically, the shift towards BRICS undermines the
              West's control over global financial systems. The NDB and other
              initiatives, such as the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA),
              provide alternatives to the financial assistance traditionally
              offered by Western-led institutions, reducing their leverage over
              developing nations. Politically, BRICS challenges the Western
              monopoly on global governance. The group's push for reforms in
              international institutions threatens to dilute the West's
              influence and redistribute power more equitably. Additionally, the
              increasing cooperation between BRICS nations on issues like
              cybersecurity, energy, and technology presents a united front that
              can counter Western policies and initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Strategically, the rise of BRICS has led to new alliances and
              partnerships that bypass traditional Western frameworks. China's
              Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for instance, creates a vast
              network of trade and investment that connects Asia, Africa, and
              Europe, reducing reliance on Western trade routes and economic
              systems. Similarly, India's Act East policy strengthens ties with
              Southeast Asia, fostering regional cooperation independent of
              Western influence. Expanded BRICS also have a tremendous influence
              in the global energy markets as 2 of the largest oil producers are
              part of BRICS. Brics countries control more than 600 billion
              barrels of oil reserves and more than 50 % of Gas reserves . There
              is also a discussion going on about creating a BRICS currency to
              reduce the influence of US dollar. If BRICS Will really be able to
              create a currency then it Will pose a significant threat to the
              dominance of US dollar .

          <div className={styles.overlay}>
            <h2>Internal Dynamics and Future Prospects</h2>
            <p>
              Despite their collective strength, BRICS nations face internal
              challenges that could impact their ability to sustain a unified
              front. Economic disparities, political differences, and varying
              levels of development create friction within the group. For
              instance, the border tensions between China and India highlight
              the geopolitical complexities that could hinder cohesive action.
              However, the shared interests and mutual benefits of cooperation
              often outweigh these differences. The collective ambition to
              reshape global governance, enhance economic development, and
              promote multipolarity provides a strong foundation for continued
              collaboration. As BRICS nations continue to grow and assert their
              influence, the balance of power in global affairs is likely to
              shift further, challenging the existing Western-dominated order.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The rise of BRICS marks a significant development in the global
              geopolitical and economic landscape. By leveraging their
              collective economic strength, advocating for political reform, and
              forging strategic alliances, BRICS nations are challenging the
              traditional dominance of Western powers. While internal dynamics
              and external pressures pose challenges, the continued rise of
              BRICS signals a move towards a more multipolar world where power
              and influence are more evenly distributed. This shift not only
              redefines global governance but also opens new avenues for
              cooperation and development across diverse regions.
