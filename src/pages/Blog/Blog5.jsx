              <u>LOK SABHA ELECTIONS 2024</u>
            </h1>
            <p>
              Elections are the key essence of a democracy and with India being
              the largest democracy around the world, its General elections had
              to be equally dramatic. The 2024 elections were held in 7nphases
              starting from 19th April to 1st June. The data reveal that the
              all-India voting percentage dropped from 67.40 per cent in 2019
              (67.10 per cent excluding postal ballots) to 65.79 in 2024.
              Remarkably, this decline in voter turnout has been sharper among
              women than men. Every election in this nation comes with its own
              new insights, so let us delve ourselves in the topic and discuss
              further. To draw understanding from the Elections, we need to
              first clear the facts well, which are presented below.

              While the pie chart is rather intimidating, to get the gist of it,
              the Bharatiya Janta Party led coalition National Democratic
              Alliance (38 parties), won 293 seats gaining the majority and
              forming the government whereas the Congress I.N.D.I alliance(20
              parties) won 232 seats creating a strong opposition. When
              comparing with the hype that was created by the Bharatiya Janta
              Party of “400 paar” and the mediocre expectation of Congress of
              just 75 seats, the results which contrasted with the result of 240
              and 99 respectively. So let us try to examine what exactly went
              along to create such a gradient.

            <h2>ABKI BAAR 400 PAAR</h2>
            <p>
              Slogans are an important part of any election campaign as they set
              the narrative of a political party. This time around the slogan
              selected by Bharatiya Janta Party was rather without a purpose.
              With the previous two elections that they won with a landslide,
              their slogans had a purpose, a sort of justification with their
              ask of seats which was rather missing this time around.
              <br />
              Example : “Acche din aane wale hain” <br />
              This time around the Slogan of 400 paar, was quite incomplete and
              sounded gaudy to a few sections of the society unlike the previous
              slogans which gave the public a common purpose that they were
              chasing. While speaking of purpose let’s examine another important
              aspect, while the BJP did not give a purpose, the purpose of the
              I.N.D.I Alliance was rather clear unlike their previous two Lok
              sabha elections, the purpose to stop BJP from taking a “huge”
              majority. While NDA chose to play with a sort of smugness and
              arrogance, I.N.D.I.A chose to play on the fear aspect.

            <h2>VOTE SHARE VS SEAT MATRIX </h2>
            <p>
              We have observed time an again that even small percentages in
              votes shares can translate into larger that expected differences
              in the number of seats. A similar trend was seen in these
              elections where a marginal drop of 0.7% of vote share lead to a
              demise of 63 seats of BJP, whereas an increment of 0.7% was enough
              to nearly double the seat tally of congress from 52 to 99. But how
              could such minor changes in vote shares cost such a huge
              difference in seat tallies?
              <br />
              That’s probably because the national vote share is an aggregation
              of states and a party may gain vote share in a state where it is
              starting from such a low base thus the addition of votes doesn’t
              translate into winning seats, while loosing the same amount in a
              highly competitive state could mean a high loss in seats. Let us
              precisely look into it state wise : <br />
              Tamil Nadu : The vote share of BJP rose from 3.6% to 11.2% but
              that added absolutely nothing to its seat tally. <br />
              Punjab : The vote share of BJP rose from 9.6% to 18.6% but the
              lack of any alliance, prevented the party to win any new seats and
              even ended up losing the two it previously had. <br />
              Bihar : A slight drop of 3% from BJP translated a loss of 5 seats.
              <br />
              West Bengal : A drop of mere 1.6% meant a loss of 6 seats for BJP.
              <br />
              Maharashtra : The vote share of BJP dropped by 1.4% meaning a loss
              of 12 seats whereas Congress mirrored it as an increase of just
              0.8% vote share led to and increase of 12 seats. <br />
              Rajasthan : Congress increased its vote share from 3.7% that meant
              a win of 8 seats.
              <br />
              What we do observe is that the gain of votes from the southern
              front for BJP did not compensate for the vote share that it lost
              from the west and north.

            <h2>RELIANCE ON ONE FACE</h2>
            <p>
              In an ideal state, elections won in every single constituency
              should be on the face of the person standing from that
              constituency but time and again in India it has been observed that
              elections are fought for and against one face. While this is an
              issue that has been since the establishment of our nation, one can
              just not talk of it enough as it is so crucial for a healthy
              democracy.
              <br />
              The election of 2024 was fought on the “face” of Prime minister
              Narendra Modi. And when one says this, it is not meant for just
              BJP but even the opposition as when the manifesto of Congress,
              “Nyay Patra” is closely examined, the ideology of congress and its
              alliance is less spoken of and more of the failures of the Prime
              Minister. The NDA has been using the Prime Minister as its entire
              campaign rather than focusing on its local candidates also.

            <h2>UTTAR PRADESH </h2>
            <p>
              Uttar Pradesh has always been very crucial for Indian politics
              purely by the virtue of numbers do speaking of it becomes must.
              While NDA was quite confident in Uttar Pradesh, the results were
              not in its favour. BJP is 4 seats behind Samajwadi Party. The
              BJP's predicament against the SP is very different from its
              performance in Bihar where both the BJP and NDA have been able to
              minimise their losses. <br />
              What explains the performance of the I.N.D.I Alliance in Uttar
              Pradesh and Bihar? <br />
              An analysis of the caste break up of the I.N.D.I Alliance in two
              states shows that the SP-led alliance had a more representative
              caste equation than the RJD led alliance in Bihar. This has
              allowed the SP to take the its strike rate close to 60% in Uttar
              Pradesh compared to just 17.4% for the RJD in Bihar. This has a
              lesson for the future of Mandal politics against the BJP. It must
              be more broad-based than the 1990s style Muslim Yadav combination.

            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>
              While the result of election may be whatever but every election in
              this nation is a triumph of democracy, there are multiple problems
              that we as a nation need to tackle and every election is a small
              step towards it. The elections of 2024 is a testament to our
              undying promise towards constitution.
