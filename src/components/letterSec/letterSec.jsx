            On behalf of my Secretariat, I welcome you all on this journey of
            youthful explorations, solving critical concerns, and more
            importantly voicing your zeal for peace. Ending my envelope with a
            notion: it takes billions of pounds to stock the weapons, millions
            of lives to victimise in wars, thousands of soldiers to fight a
            battle, but only ane pen to hunch the harmony! <br />
            <br />
            Ware Regards <br />
            Ronak Jain <br />
            General Secretary <br />
